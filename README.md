# odin-recipes

This repository will showcase my skills which i have learnt from The
Odin Project. Those skills like correct text formatting and what tags to be used in 
it. Ordered and unordered list were also showcased together with links and images.
One important thing also is how to use git commit message properly. With this much for now,
lessons were focused on html, but as it goes on styles and  interactivity will also be 
implemented in the future.
